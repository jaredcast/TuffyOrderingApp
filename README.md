Tuffy Ordering - a Flutter / Dart app that simulates customers logging in to place an order. Business owners can log in to view these orders.

Some features were missing due to time, such as special deals, recommendations, a card security system, business info, and advertisements.

Worked alongside Firebase and Firestore.

To run, connect with an Android emulator and run main.dart
